##About me
<p>My career have started in big fin-tech. I have stared as fraud-monitoring administrator while studied in university. Then I moved to QA in the same compamy after graduation in 2016. I am still working as QA engineer. My current project related with payment documents exchange between banks by SWIFT and national payment system.  However I want to change my career as manual tester and become an autotester or front-ed engineer.
